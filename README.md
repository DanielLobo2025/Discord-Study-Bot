# discordstudybot

Learning how to use git and the discord API to create bots for servers. Starting off with something basic, creating a study bot that with a command will track how long you have been studying for and will remind you to have a break every 25 minutes.
You have the ability to end the study session as well. 

Commands so far

!start (starts study session)
!end (Ends study session)
!hello (Returns hello)
!add  (adds any amount of intergers, ex. !add 2 3 5 1, it will return the result)

I will be adding other features soon this is just version 1, I am also trying to learn how to use git as I will need to know it on the job.
