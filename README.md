# discordstudybot

## Summary

I am still developing and changing this project. I used python and Node.js to create a study bot which keeps track of study sessions and informs you when to take breaks. It follows the pomodoro method where you do 25 minutes of work then take a 5 minute break then contine. You can end the session and see how long you studied for. I recently added the ability to ask chatgpt questions from the discord server and it will reply with the answer to said question. It uses chatgpt 3.5 turbo to answer these questions.
